## StaticJS

Static is a dynamic JavaScript framework that brings together all that's wrong about other frameworks!

### Who's it for?

- AngularJS lets people abuse the $scope? **Wait until you see what we've got for you!**
- React has a "licensing" problem? **We encourage you to read StricJS license**
- Vue is maintained by few people? **Hey... It's just me here!**
- Angular 2/4 introduced too many breaking changes? **Wait until you see the StaticJS v1.01 spec...**

If you've answered yes to some of the above questions, than StaticJS **is not** for you. In that case, we encourage you to write your own JS framework and market the shit out of it until it becomes the next soon-to-be-big-thing-thats-going-to-be-forgotten-in-about-2-months-time!
